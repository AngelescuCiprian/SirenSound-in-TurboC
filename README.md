# SirenSound-in-TurboC
Siren Sound Simulation in Turbo C++
To run this code you need to download Turbo C++: https://developerinsider.co/download-turbo-c-for-windows-7-8-8-1-and-windows-10-32-64-bit-full-screen/
The <dos.h> header is no longer available in modern compilers.
This C program generates a siren-like sound using the sound(), nosound(), and delay() functions from dos.h, which are available in Turbo C++. The program loops three times, first increasing the frequency from 500 Hz to 1500 Hz to create a rising tone, then decreasing the frequency back to 500 Hz to create a falling tone. This cycle is repeated to mimic a siren effect.

ðŸ”¹ Requirements: Turbo C++ compiler
ðŸ”¹ Usage: Compile and run the program in Turbo C++ to hear the siren sound.
